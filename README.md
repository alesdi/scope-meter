# ScopeMeter

A simple web app to help you analyze oscilloscope captured screenshots.

Just drag and drop a screenshot on the page and use different tools to take measures with physical units and easily obtain time constants for exponential transients, frequencies of periodic signals and more.

ScopeMeter is built with SvelteKit. After cloning the repository and installing dependencies with `npm run i`, you can run the app in a development server with `npm run dev`.
